This is a try to add remote repository by using `git config` command.

It turns out, that this is possible. Now I will make a few more tests, like some push and pull tests and after that, I'll try adding a new branch through `git config`<br>
Then, I will add here steps taken to achieve that.<br>
This is edited on GitHub so I can try pulling.

This is only visible on branch "disciple":<br>
Created new branch "disciple" and not edited `config` file to see what will happen.

It turns out that there is no need to edit `config` file, git automatically sets up new remote branch while pushing.<br>
**EDIT:** Well, now it turns out that for pushing there is no need to edit `config` file, but for pulling it must be done. ;-)<br>

Now, I am thinking that it may be possible to set up completely new remote for a branch. But, I don't see any reason why would someone do that. Anyway, I'll try it, just out of curiosity.
