This is a try to add remote repository by using `git config` command.

It turns out, that this is possible. Now I will make a few more tests, like some push and pull tests and after that, I'll try adding a new branch through `git config`<br>
Then, I will add here steps taken to achieve that.<br>
This is edited on GitHub so I can try pulling.
