This is a try to add remote repository by using `git config` command.

It turns out, that this is possible. Now I will make a few more tests, like some push and pull tests and after that, I'll try adding a new branch through `git config`<br>
Then, I will add here steps taken to achieve that.<br>
This is edited on GitHub so I can try pulling.<br>

***The "apprentice" branch:***

This is only visible on the branch "apprentice".
Now, I created new branch "apprentice", and edited `config` file to set up remote branch for it.<br>

It all works, pushing and pulling, for this branch.
New line, to test some git push commands.
